Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

First of all, thanks for checking out AIM. I have started thinking about [Prompt-driven Programming](/blog/welcome) while ago and after a few weeks of drafting a solution, I'm finally ready to share it with you.

Here are the things that you should know about AIM:
- AIM is a **programming (natural) language** written in Markdown with a few extensions. Knowing Markdown is a plus, but not required.
- AIM aims to be a **simple** and **flexible** way to express your solutions to problems, using natural language.
- AIM is not perfect and it is the result of my thought process around the relatively new concept of [Prompt-driven Programming](/blog/welcome).

If this sounds interesting to you, you can keep scrolling down.

First of all, the famous [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) example in AIM looks like this: 

```aim title="hello-world.aim"
Hello, World!
```

Of course, this is not your common programming language, but it is the most natural way to express solutions to problems.

Let's take a look at an interactive example. Note that in this example, we're using different programming languages (Python and JavaScript) to print similar messages. **You can click the "Run" button to see the output**.

import {CodePreview} from '@site/src/components/code-preview';

<CodePreview title="another-example.aim" example="dreamer"></CodePreview>

This demonstrates how AIM can seamlessly integrate multiple languages in a single document, while maintaining readability and flow. The code blocks are embedded naturally within the markdown text, making it easy to combine narrative and executable code.

Now let's dive into the Getting Started section to learn more about how to use AIM.

### Inspiration

I think it is important to mention that there are many other projects that inspired me to create AIM.

1. [Wordware](https://wordware.ai) - IDE that enables users to build complex AI agents and applications using natural language programming.
2. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) - Interactive computing environment that allows users to write and execute code in multiple programming languages.
3. [Tldraw Computer](https://computer.tldraw.com/) - An infinite canvas for natural language computing. Create workflows of connected components that generate and transform data, using a multi-modal language model as a runtime to execute instructions.
4. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - An app for taking notes, linking them together, and building a knowledge base. The founder is also very inspiring with blog posts like [File Over App](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).
5. [Ink And Switch - End-user Programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/) - An article that explores the idea of end-user programming.
6. [Greg Fodor's "Rebooting the Web in 3D with Webspaces"](https://gfodor.medium.com/rebooting-the-web-in-3d-with-webspaces-9e58847e042c/) - An article exploring how to create self-hosted 3D worlds using HTML.

And a few others I can't think of right now.
