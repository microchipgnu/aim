Yooo! Micro's here again and this time to talk a bit about where this project is at.

I went radio silent for a month because I was mostly busy collecting feedback and preparing for an official release, but most importantly **experimenting a LOT with AIM**. 

After my last post, I spent a good amount of time building things with AIM and I feel that the best way to test productivity is by building something at hackathons.

Hackathons put the pressure on you to build something in a short amount of time and that's a great way to test your ideas.

Before we proceed, do you remember this tweet? If not that's fine, but when I said it I truly meant it.

And for this time let's try something fun and play a song while you're reading this post.

This is a post will cover the three hackathons I participated in and the projects I built:

- [ETHGlobal Agentic Ethereum](https://ethglobal.com/events/agents)
- [Sui Agent Typhoon](https://sui.io/sui-agent-typhoon/)
- [Sozu Virtual Hack](https://x.com/sozuhaus/status/1888977562900332940/)

I picked these hackathons because I've been involved with the crypto community and can get a pretty quick grasp of what is missing and is useful to build at these events. 


Lets start with the first hackathon.
## AIMen üôè

The first hackathon I participated in was [ETHGlobal Agentic Ethereum](https://ethglobal.com/events/agents). The project was AIMen (pronounced "aim-en"). 
The goal with this project was to have a self-hosted environment that would allow people to bootstrap and server their documents while tapping into the existing toolkits and tools.

When I started this hackathon, AIM was in a very early stage. I was able to run basic documents, but it was missing features like tools, plugins  and ways to compose and reuse workflows.

So I decided to expand the AIM runtime to accept tools and plugins. Once that was done, my hack consisted of integrating with [Coinbase AgentKit](https://www.coinbase.com/en-pt/developer-platform/discover/launches/introducing-agentkit) and building AI tools for the [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/).

The goal was to have a self-hosted environment that would allow people to bootstrap and server their documents.

### Technical Details

To initiate a project with AIM, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx aimx@0.1.56 init
```

This will create a basic project ready to be deployed. It will also create a `aim.config.ts` file that you can use to configure your project. I wanted to set tools and plugins in the config file.

And that's it for the first hackathon. Here's the announcement of the finalists:

## Suiiii

The second hackathon I participated in was [Sui Agent Typhoon](https://sui.io/sui-agent-typhoon/) with Suiiii (a reference to Cristiano Ronaldo).

My gut feeling told me that although the first hackathon was successful, there are probably easier ways to do this. And I realized that there was another hackathon happening and I had around 48h to submit something.

It was Saturday night and I told B√°rbara (my fiance√©) that I was going to be building something else until the end of the weekend. She was like "another one? üôÑ" and I was like "yes, another üò´".

I started this hackathon with a pretty clear vision of how the plugin system and tools were working. 

But little did I know that the Sui ecosystem didn't have many AI toolkits and with less than 48h to submit, I had to build something fast.

This was my first time learning about Sui.

So... I decided to write a simple workflow that would get me relevant information about Sui.

```aim

## Sui Agent Typhoon

I'm a newcomer to the Sui blockchain. Please explain what Sui is all about.

```

I decided to integrate several projects from the ecosystem as AI tools, namely: 

- Sui: for account management, generate transactions, submit transactions, etc.
- Suilend: for minting and redeeming sSUI 
- Bluefin: Dex integration and querying state
- NAVI: API wrapper for NAVI 
- Atoma: decentralized inference


Here's the demo I did for the hackathon:

To my surprise, I got accepted as a finalist and demoed my project! Here's the announcement of the winners:

## [Sozu Virtual Hack](https://x.com/sozuhaus/status/1888977562900332940/)

After presenting to ETHGlobal on Friday (February 14th), I got a DM from [@kellykim](https://x.com/kellykim_xyz) asking if I was interested in joining a hackathon. I was like, "sure, why not? I have less than 12h to build something but I'll try".

Saturday morning (the day of the deadline), I woke up with pretty much no idea about what Mantle was and how to build something for its ecosystem, but I already had a good boilerplate to work with from the previous Sui hackathon.

So... I decided to do expand the app and integrate [Reown AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/overview) to let users connect their wallets. The idea was to make useful consumer agentic workflows for some of the most popular apps on Mantle.

Then I stumbled upon [GOAT SDK](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat) and was pretty amazed with all the tools it provides.



I got accepted as a finalist and demoed my project! I didn't win any prize, but I had a lot of fun building this and still got a pool prize. Here's the announcement of pool prize winners:

With this I also got the opportunity to stay at [Sozu Haus](https://x.com/sozuhaus), attend ETHDenver and meet some amazing builders in the space.

If you're interested in talking IRL about this stuff, hit me up! Make sure to follow me on [X](https://x.com/microchipgnu). I also started a little community on Telegram [writeAIM](https://t.me/writeAIM) where we discuss all things AIM.
