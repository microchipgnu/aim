Hello! It‚Äôs Micro here again, and I‚Äôm excited to share an update on my project, AIM, and how I‚Äôve been testing it through hackathons.

I‚Äôve been quiet for about a month, as I‚Äôve been deeply engaged in gathering feedback, preparing for an official release, and, most importantly, experimenting extensively with AIM. After my last post, I dedicated significant time to building with AIM, and I believe hackathons‚Äîthose intense, time-constrained events‚Äîare the ideal way to evaluate its productivity and potential.

<!-- truncate -->

This post will cover the three hackathons I participated in and the projects I developed:

- [ETHGlobal Agentic Ethereum](https://ethglobal.com/events/agents)
- [Sui Agent Typhoon](https://sui.io/sui-agent-typhoon/)
- [Sozu Virtual Hack](https://x.com/sozuhaus/status/1888977562900332940/)

I chose these hackathons because of my involvement in the crypto community, which gives me a strong sense of what‚Äôs needed and what innovative solutions I can build during these events.

Before we dive in, you might recall this tweet I shared earlier‚Äîthough I doubt it‚Äôs fresh in your memory, I was sincere when I posted it.

## AIMen üôè

Let‚Äôs start with [ETHGlobal Agentic Ethereum](https://ethglobal.com/events/agents). For this hackathon, I developed **AIMen** (pronounced ‚Äúaim-en‚Äù), a project aimed at creating a self-hosted environment where users can bootstrap and serve their documents while leveraging existing toolkits and AI tools.

At the outset, AIM was in its early stages. I could run basic documents, but it lacked critical features like tools, plugins, and the ability to compose or reuse workflows effectively. To address this, I expanded the AIM runtime to support tools and plugins. Once that was implemented, I integrated it with [Coinbase AgentKit](https://www.coinbase.com/en-pt/developer-platform/discover/launches/introducing-agentkit) for advanced AI functionalities and built AI tools for [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/) to access blockchain data.

The objective was to create a robust, self-hosted platform where users could easily initialize documents and utilize AIM‚Äôs AI agents for Ethereum-based projects. It was challenging but rewarding to see it come together.

Here‚Äôs the finalist demo I presented for Agentic Ethereum:

To begin a project with AIM, I used the following command:

```bash
npx aimx@0.1.56 init
```

This command generates a basic, deploy-ready project and creates a `aim.config.ts` file for configuration. I used this file to define tools and plugins, such as Coinbase AgentKit and TheGraph. Here‚Äôs an example of how I structured the configuration:

```ts
// Export a function that returns the config
export default async function getConfig() {
    try {
        const { agentKit, langChainTools } = await initializeAgentKit();
        const convertedTools = Object.fromEntries(langChainTools.map((tool) => [tool.name, convertLangChainTool(tool)]));

        return {
            tools: [
                ...Object.values(convertedTools),
                ...Object.values(theGraphTools),
            ],
            plugins: [
                {
                    plugin: {
                        name: 'base',
                        version: '0.0.1',
                        tags: {
                            "list-actions": {
                                render: "list-actions",
                                execute: async function* ({ node, config, state }) {
                                    try {
                                        const actions = agentKit.getActions();
                                        
                                        state.context.methods.addToTextRegistry({ 
                                            text: JSON.stringify(actions), 
                                            scope: "global" 
                                        });
                                        
                                        yield new Tag("p", {}, [
                                            Object.values(actions).map((action) => action.name).join(", ")
                                        ]);
                                    } catch (error) {
                                        console.error('Error executing list-actions:', error);
                                        yield new Tag("p", {}, ["Error listing actions"]);
                                    }
                                }
                            },
                        }
                    }
                }
            ],
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in config initialization:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

I also developed **tool converters** to ensure I could integrate Langchain tools with AIM, especially because the Coinbase AgentKit was using Langchain tools. It required some effort to map these formats correctly, but once resolved, it significantly improved AIM‚Äôs functionality.

That concludes my experience with AIMen. Here‚Äôs the announcement of the finalists:

## Suiiii

Next, I participated in [Sui Agent Typhoon](https://sui.io/sui-agent-typhoon/), where I created **Suiiii** (inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄúSiuuuu!‚Äù). After the success of ETHGlobal, I felt there might be more efficient approaches, and I noticed another hackathon opportunity with a tight 48-hour deadline to submit.

It was a Saturday evening when I informed my fianc√©e, B√°rbara, that I‚Äôd be focusing on building another project through the weekend. She responded with a playful, ‚ÄúAnother one? üôÑ,‚Äù and I replied, somewhat exasperated, ‚ÄúYes, another one üò´.‚Äù Such is the life of a hackathon enthusiast!

I began with a clear understanding of AIM‚Äôs plugin system and tools. However, I encountered a challenge: I was new to the Sui ecosystem, which had limited AI toolkits available. With less than 48 hours, I needed to act quickly.

I developed a straightforward workflow to gather relevant information about Sui:

```aim
# Sui Agent Typhoon

I‚Äôm new to the Sui blockchain. Could you provide an overview of what Sui entails?

## Recent News

What are the most significant recent developments about Sui? Please find news from Q4 2024 to 2025.

{% ai #news model="openai/gpt-4o:online@openrouter" /%}
```


I then integrated several projects from the Sui ecosystem as AI tools:

- **Sui**: For managing accounts, generating and submitting transactions, and other core blockchain operations.
- **Suilend**: For minting and redeeming sSUI, Sui‚Äôs staking token.
- **Bluefin**: A decentralized exchange (DEX) integration for trading and state queries.
- **NAVI**: An API wrapper to access NAVI‚Äôs services and data.
- **Atoma**: Leveraging decentralized inference for AI processing.

Despite the time constraint, I completed the project successfully and wrote several tools to integrate with the Sui ecosystem. Here‚Äôs the demo I presented:

To my delight, I was selected as a finalist and had the opportunity to demo live. Here‚Äôs the announcement of the winners:

This experience taught me how adaptable AIM can be, even when working with unfamiliar ecosystems under pressure.

## AIMantle

Following my presentation at ETHGlobal on Friday, February 14th, I received a direct message from [@kellykim](https://x.com/kellykim_xyz) inviting me to join another [hackathon](https://x.com/sozuhaus/status/1888977562900332940/). I responded enthusiastically, ‚ÄúSure, why not? I have less than 12 hours to build something, but I‚Äôm up for the challenge.‚Äù

By Saturday morning‚Äîthe deadline‚ÄîI had little knowledge of Mantle or its ecosystem. However, I leveraged the solid foundation I built during the Sui hackathon, using it as a starting point.

I decided to enhance the application by integrating [Reown AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/overview), enabling users to connect their wallets. My goal was to create practical, user-focused agentic workflows for some of Mantle‚Äôs most popular applications, such as DeFi platforms and NFT tools.

During this process, I discovered [GOAT SDK](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat), which impressed me with its extensive toolkit for AI and blockchain integration. I incorporated it into AIM, enhancing its ability to handle on-chain actions and wallet interactions effectively.

Find the project repository [here](https://github.com/microchipgnu/sozu-virtual-hack-03).

I was thrilled to be selected as a finalist and present my project. While I didn‚Äôt win a top prize, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and received a pool prize. Here‚Äôs the announcement for the pool prize winners:

Additionally, this hackathon opened doors to exciting opportunities. I will have the chance to stay at [Sozu Haus](https://x.com/sozuhaus), a vibrant hub for web3 builders, where I will connect with remarkable developers and explore their projects while attending ETHDenver, one of the best and largest web3 events.
