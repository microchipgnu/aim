title: Inspiration and Resources
---

I think it is important to mention that there are many other projects and resources that inspired me to create AIM and that I used to actively shape the direction of this project.

1. [Wordware](https://wordware.ai) - IDE that enables users to build complex AI agents and applications using natural language programming.
2. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) - Interactive computing environment that allows users to write and execute code in multiple programming languages.
3. [Tldraw Computer](https://computer.tldraw.com/) - An infinite canvas for natural language computing. Create workflows of connected components that generate and transform data, using a multi-modal language model as a runtime to execute instructions.
4. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - An app for taking notes, linking them together, and building a knowledge base. The founder is also very inspiring with blog posts like [File Over App](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).
5. [Ink And Switch - End-user Programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/) - An article that explores the idea of end-user programming.
6. [Greg Fodor's "Rebooting the Web in 3D with Webspaces"](https://gfodor.medium.com/rebooting-the-web-in-3d-with-webspaces-9e58847e042c/) - An article exploring how to create self-hosted 3D worlds using HTML.

And a few others I can't think of right now.
