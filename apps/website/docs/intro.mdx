Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

First of all, thanks for checking out AIM. I have started thinking about [Prompt-driven Programming](/blog/welcome) while ago and after a few weeks of drafting a solution, I'm finally ready to share it with you.

Here are the things that you should know about AIM:
- AIM is a **(natural) programming language** written in Markdown with a few extensions. Knowing Markdown is a plus, but not required.
- AIM aims to be a **simple** and **flexible** way to express your solutions to problems, using natural language.
- AIM is not perfect and it is the result of my thought process around the relatively new concept of [Prompt-driven Programming](/blog/welcome).

If this sounds interesting to you, you can keep scrolling down.

First of all, the famous [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) example in AIM looks like this: 

```aim title="hello-world.aim"
Hello, World!
```

Of course, this is not your common programming language, but it is the most natural way to express solutions to problems.

Let's take a look at an interactive example. Note that in this example, we're using different programming languages (Python and JavaScript) to print similar messages. **You can click the "Run" button to see the output**.

import {CodePreview} from '@site/src/components/code-preview';

<CodePreview title="another-example.aim" example="dreamer"></CodePreview>

This demonstrates how AIM can seamlessly integrate multiple languages in a single document, while maintaining readability and flow. The code blocks are embedded naturally within the markdown text, making it easy to combine narrative and executable code.
